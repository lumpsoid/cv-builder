# CV Generation

You will need to provide content in `md` format in the `./src/content/` folder. After that, you can run `nix run ./src` to generate PDFs. They will be in the `output` folder.

You can customize which `md` files to include in the CV and their order in the `cv-pdf.sh` file.

`cv.md` must be provided in the `content` folder; it will always be at the top part.
